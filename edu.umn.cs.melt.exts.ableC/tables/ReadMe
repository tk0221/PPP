We would like a the following boolean valued expression
to translate to the C code that follows it.

Note that if there are side effects in the table conditions, they may
be executed more than once.


  In
      c = table (
          e1 : T F,
          e2 : F *,
          e3 : T T );
 
 table forwards to
   
   ({ int c1 = e1; int c2 = e2; int c3 = e3;
      (c1 && ! c2 && c3) || ( ! c1 && 1 && c3 ) ; })
